```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = this(0) // Auxiliary constructor
}
```
This code might seem correct, but it has a subtle bug related to how the auxiliary constructor is used.  If `MyClass` is extended to a subclass, and that subclass tries to call a different constructor in its auxiliary constructor, it won't work as expected, leading to unexpected behaviour or compilation errors.

For example:
```scala
class MySubClass(y: Int) extends MyClass(y) {
  def this() = this(1) // Trying to call the MySubClass's constructor
}
```
This will produce a compilation error, as the superclass constructor isn't called correctly via an auxiliary constructor within the subclass.
